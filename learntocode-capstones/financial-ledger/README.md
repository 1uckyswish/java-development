# Capstone 1 - Accounting Ledger Application

Welcome to the Financial Transaction Tracker repository! This CLI application, built using Java, is designed to help you efficiently track all financial transactions for either business or personal use. With easy-to-use screens and intuitive functionalities, managing your finances has never been more straightforward.

## Interesting Section of code

This code is interesting because instead of users having to input the date and time themselves, it automatically fetches the current date and time. This is helpful when users want to record a transaction they just made and display it instantly. It also benefits users who might not remember or know the exact date or time, as the feature handles that for them.
