# Capstone 2 - Delicious Sandwiches


Welcome to my second capstone project, where I bring to life the pillars of Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that I've spent several weeks learning. This project serves as a culmination of my journey in mastering Java OOP principles. Through this project, I'll demonstrate the practical application of key OOP concepts including encapsulation, polymorphism, inheritance, abstraction, and interfaces. It's an opportunity for me to showcase my understanding and proficiency in implementing these fundamental concepts in a real-world scenario.
## Overview
This project aims to automate the order process for DELI-cious, a growing sandwich shop. With this application, customers can easily place their orders, customize their sandwiches, and even add drinks, chips, and cookies to their orders. Let's explore the features and functionality of our application:

## Features
- **Order Customization**: Customers can fully customize their sandwich orders by choosing the size, type of bread, toppings, meats, cheeses, and sauces.
- **Multiple Sizes**: Sandwiches are available in three sizes: 4", 8", and 12".
- **Premium Toppings**: Premium toppings such as meats and cheeses come at an additional cost.
- **Toasting Option**: Customers can choose whether they want their sandwich toasted.
- **Add-ons**: Customers can enhance their orders by adding drinks, chips, and cookies.
- **Cookie Selection**: Customers can choose between a sugar cookie or chocolate chip cookie to complement their order.
- **Order Summary**: Before finalizing the order, customers can review their selections and verify that the order is correct.
- **Checkout**: Once the order is confirmed, the application displays the total cost of the order.

## Signature Sandwiches
To streamline the ordering process, we've created several Signature Sandwiches that serve as templates for customer orders. Customers can choose from these Signature Sandwiches and then customize the toppings according to their preferences. Here are a couple of examples:

### BLT
- **Bread**: 8" white bread
- **Toppings**: Bacon, Cheddar, Lettuce, Tomato
- **Sauce**: Ranch
- **Toasted**: Yes

### Philly Cheese Steak
- **Bread**: 8" white bread
- **Toppings**: Steak, American Cheese, Peppers
- **Sauce**: Mayo
- **Toasted**: Yes

Customers can modify these Signature Sandwiches by adding or removing toppings to suit their taste.

## Interesting Section of code
This code snippet introduces a unique feature where the user is informed that going back to the home screen will reset their cart. To implement this functionality, each time the Main class is instantiated, a new cart object is created, ensuring that any previous cart contents are discarded. This prevents unintended persistence of items in the cart across sessions.

By providing a message to the user, they are informed of the consequence of proceeding, enabling them to make an informed decision. This design choice ensures a seamless user experience while maintaining the integrity of the ordering process.
