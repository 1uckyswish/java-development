# Interesting Section of code
### Recursion for Error Handling
When you choose the wrong calculator option, the program utilizes recursion to guide you back to the correct selection process.
Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. It is a powerful concept.
This is a great example of recursion in action, showcasing its versatility and effectiveness in problem-solving within the context of our financial calculators program.
